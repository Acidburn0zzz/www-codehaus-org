If you would like your projects links redirected then please see our <a href='https://github.com/codehaus/redirector'>redirector repository</a> 

1. create a sane *squashed* pull request
1. wait for it to be merged and deployed
1. verify it does what you expected.

You may add some 302s initially, but ultimately all redirects will be amended to 301s over time (to reduce bandwidth requirements).

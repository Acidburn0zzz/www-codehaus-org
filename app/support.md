Codehaus no longer hosts any software - the projects that it hosted are primarily on Github - but some moved to Apache or other locations.

Check out our <a href='/projects/'>project list</a>.

Failing that, you should search the internet for the new location of software.

If you get really, really desperate you can try emailing support, but that would be as a last resort only.
